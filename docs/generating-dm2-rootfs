Flow for creating a test rootfs for SD card
===========================================

1) Currently, go into gta02-dm2 subdir and do ./build
   which generates DM2-specific files in dm2.tar.gz

2) Make sure you have the final images you want to
   flash on the produced devices in ./final-images.
   These look like this for example:

     nor.bin-gta02v5-20080305
     rootfs.jffs2
     u-boot.bin
     uImage.bin

2) Still in gta02-dm2, as root, run

     ./generate-test-rootfs

   (You can use "skip" argument to stop it
   downloading latest normal rootfs from buildhost)

   This will fetch the latest normal rootfs tarball,
   modify it, unpack the dm2.tar.gz DM2 files into
   it, unpack a canned set of devices into it so
   we don't have to run udev, and tarball the result
   up again as rootfs-dm2.tar.gz

3) Insert your SD card into your card reader on PC
   Mount the second partition ext2 somewhere

   *** IMPORTANT *** confirm it did not mount nodev!
   If it did (some udev is set up for this) then as
   root remount without nodev something like this

     mount /dev/sdf2 /media/disk-1 -oremount,rw

4) cd into the SD card mountpoint, eg

     cd /media/disk-1
     tar xf /path/to/rootfs-dm2.tar.gz

5) umount the SD card (both partitions if automounted)

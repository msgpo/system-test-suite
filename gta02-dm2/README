== Introduction ==

DM2 (as known as "Diagnosis Module phase 2") is designed for
resource constrained environments or production testing software
usage.It depends on oltk in kernel.

== Building ==

For now, you can build with the toolchain from

http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Toolchain

and running the ./build script.  If you have the usb0 device set up
from Ethernet over USB on GTA02, you can do

./build && remote_install

in order to build and get dm2 and other dependent apps installed on the
GTA02.

If you change configuration, provoke a reconfigure by deleting the
Makefile.

== Principle ==

DM2 was excuted by test script through oltk supporting.(oltk was built 
from scratch with mininal UI implementations in mind.Unlike classical 
GUI toolkits, oltk adopts "semi-event loop" approach instead of 
maintaining its own event loop.  The approach is targetted in embedded 
applications such as u-boot integration.)
